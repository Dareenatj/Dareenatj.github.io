      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I'm Dareenat (Daisy) Jakdetchai, a second-year Physics Specialist and CS Minor student at the University of Toronto.</p>
      <p>I’m passionate about the intersection of physics, biology, and computing. 
        I don’t feel limited to one path — there’s so much I want to learn, and I believe that connecting ideas across disciplines is where real insight happens.</p>
      <p>Outside of academics, I love painting, drawing, and collecting plants — especially cacti!</p>
